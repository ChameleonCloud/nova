    The ironic virt driver no longer reports an empty inventory for bare metal
    nodes that have instances on them. Instead the custom resource class, VCPU,
    memory and disk are reported as they are configured on the node.

    Due to the changes in scheduling of bare metal nodes, additional resources
    may be reported as free to Placement. This happens in two cases:

    * An instance is deployed with a flavor smaller than a node (only possible
      when exact filters are not used)
    * Node properties were modified in ironic for a deployed node

    When such instances are deployed in Ocata, it is possible for the scheduler
    to try deploying another instance on the same node. It will cause a failure
    in the compute and a scheduling retry.

    The recommended work around is to upgrade to Pike and assign a resource
    class to all ironic nodes, and use it for scheduling of bare metal
    instances.
